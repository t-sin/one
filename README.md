One provides a framework for processing input like stream, pathname and sequence.

## Installation

```
$ ros install t-sin/one
```

If you try *one* in REPL, load with quicklisp:

```lisp
> (ql:quickload :one)
```

If you use *one* as one-liner, it is useful that this template:

```sh
$ ros run -s one -e '(one:for ...)' -q
```

## Motivation

Sometime, I summarized CSV file with UNIX commands, like this:

```sh
$ cat data.csv
id1,1
id2,2
id3,3
$ cat data.csv | awk -F , '{sum+=$2}END{print sum}'
9
```

But I thought: awk is complex, I want to write it with Common Lisp. Then, I do:

```sh
$ cut -d ',' -f 2 data.csv | ros run -e '(print (loop for line = (read *standard-input* nil :eof) until (eq :eof line) sum line))' -q
9
```

*WTF? Maybe it's 'cause of the specters!!*

However, with this library that I wrote, that crazy one-liner turns into like this:

```sh
$ cut -d ',' -f 2 data.csv | ros run -s one -e '(one:for* - < one:read* +> + 0)' -q
```

*OMG! It's shockingly NICE! 😇*

*One* aimed to write shortly input processing with some feature.

This is the reason which to use *one*.


## Basis

*One* provides three feature in `one:for` macro:

1. less typing for `*standard-input*` (that is `-`)
2. loop absctraction over pathnames, streams and sequences
3. operator composition like pipe on shell or function composition

## Usage

We should tell two things to *one*: **input** and **operations** applied to input. Like pipe in UNIX shell, *one* passes and process the result of left process, and so on.

Generally, `one:for` should be used like this (with REGEX like notation for description):

```lisp
(one:for <input> [<connective> <operation>]*)
```

### Basis

TBD

### Examples

- `cat file.txt`

```sh
$ ros -s one -e '(one:for #P"file.txt" < one:read-line* $ print)' -q
```

- `cat file.txt | grep hoge`

```sh
$ ros -s one -e '(one:for #P"file.txt" < one:read-line* ? (search "hoge" _) $ print)' -q
```

- `cat file.csv | awk -F , '{s+=$2}END{print s}'`

```sh
# long...
$ ros run -s one -s split-sequence -e '(one:for* #P"file.csv" < one:read-line* $ (split-sequence:split-sequence #\, _) $ (nth 1 _) $ read-from-string +> + 0)' -q
```

    - He shew me an idea as code snippet, how to process lazy, that give me lots of inspiration.
