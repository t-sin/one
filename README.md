## Installation

```
$ ros install t-sin/one
```

If you try *one* in REPL, load with quicklisp:

```lisp
> (ql:quickload :one)
```

If you use *one* as one-liner, `ros one` subcommand for roswell is useful:

```sh
$ ros one '(one:for ...)'
```

### Examples

- print all lines in `access.log`, it's equivalent to `cat access.log`

```sh
$ ros one '(one:for #P"access.log" < one:read-line* $ one:print*)'
xxx.xxx.xxx.xx - - [dd/Jul/2017:17:59:03 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 206 31140 "-" "UserAgentName"
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [dd/Jul/2017:18:00:47 +0000] "GET /foo.js HTTP/1.1" 200 13944 "-" "UserAgentName"
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [dd/Jul/2017:18:19:23 +0000] "GET /foo.js HTTP/1.1" 200 13944 "-" "UserAgentName"
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [dd/Jul/2017:19:50:55 +0000] "GET /bar.js HTTP/1.1" 200 13944 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 ..."
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [dd/Jul/2017:20:03:40 +0000] "GET /bar.js HTTP/1.1" 200 13944 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 ..."
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [dd/Jul/2017:20:07:18 +0000] "GET /bazz.html HTTP/1.1" 200 13944 "-" "..."
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [dd/Jul/2017:20:07:18 +0000] "GET /foo.html HTTP/1.1" 200 13944 "-" "..."
```

- print lines s.t. it satisfies regex `.*foo.*`

```sh
$ ros one '(one:for #P"access.log" < one:read-line* ? #/(search "foo" _) $ one:print*)'
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [dd/Jul/2017:18:00:47 +0000] "GET /foo.js HTTP/1.1" 200 13944 "-" "UserAgentName"
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [dd/Jul/2017:18:19:23 +0000] "GET /foo.js HTTP/1.1" 200 13944 "-" "UserAgentName"
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [dd/Jul/2017:20:07:18 +0000] "GET /foo.html HTTP/1.1" 200 13944 "-" "..."
```

- print sum of proc time for `foo.js`

```sh
$ ros one '(one:for #P"access.log" < one:read-line* ? #/(search "foo.js" _) $ #/(ppcre:regex-replace ".+200 (\\d+).+" _ "\\1") $ parse-integer +> + 0 $ one:print*)'
27888
```


## Motivation

Sometime, I summarized CSV file with UNIX commands, like this:

```sh
$ cat data.csv
id1,1
id2,2
id3,3
$ cat data.csv | awk -F , '{sum+=$2}END{print sum}'
9
```

But I thought: awk is complex, I want to write it with Common Lisp. Then, I do:

```sh
$ cut -d ',' -f 2 data.csv | ros run -e '(print (loop for line = (read *standard-input* nil :eof) until (eq :eof line) sum line))' -q
9
```

*WTF? Maybe it's 'cause of the specters!!*

However, with this library that I wrote, that crazy one-liner turns into like this:

```sh
$ cut -d ',' -f 2 data.csv | ros one '(one:for* - < one:read* +> + 0)'
```

*OMG! It's shockingly NICE! ðŸ˜‡*

*One* aimed to write shortly input processing with some features.

This is the reason which to use *one*.


## Basis

*One* provides three features in `one:for` macro:

1. less typing for `*standard-input*` (that is `-`)
2. loop absctraction over pathnames, streams and sequences
3. operator composition like pipe on shell or function composition

## Usage

We should tell two things to *one*: **input** and **operations** applied to input. Like pipe in UNIX shell, *one* passes and process the result of left process to right, and so on. One **operation** is placed with **connective**, it denotes a behavior; composition, reduce, scan on...

Generally, `one:for` should be used like this (with REGEX like notation for explain):

```lisp
(one:for <input> [<connective> <operation>]*)
```

### Input

`<input>` can take **pathname**, **stream** (includes `*standard-input*`) and **sequence**. Reading and looping on stream and sequence is hidden behind `one:for` macro, but we can specify how to read from stream or sequence. For details, see *Scanning on pathname, stream or sequence*.

### Operations

`<operation>` is a function that takes one argument. Basically, previous result is applied with operation then its result passed the next operation. Operations can be those:

- a function
- a symbol such that it is a function name (`#'` is automatically inserted)
- a lambda expression

For the purpose of less typing, *one* provides reader macro `#/` for lambda expression. Example is like this:

```lisp
#/(string= _ "ichi")
;; -> (lambda (input) (string= input "ichi"))
```

Note that **the symbol `_` in `#/` is replaced with the argument of function

### Connectives

Each *connective* denotes a behavior. There are five connectives; `$` (composition), `<` (scanning), `>` (gathering), `+>` (folding) and `?` (filtering).

#### `$`: Operation Composition

Composition behavior connects previoues function to next function.

```lisp
(one:for <input> ... $ <operation> ...)
```

Example:

```lisp
> (one:for "ichi" $ #/(format nil "~a ni" _) $ print)
"ichi ni"
```

#### `<`: Scanning on pathname, stream or sequence

Scanning behavior reads for each element and applies operation on previous result, that can be pathname, stream or sequence.

```lisp
(one:for <input> ... < <next-fn> ...)
```

We can specify how to read element, as `<next-fn>`. For instance `cdr` for lists, `one:read-line*` for stream. Note that `<next-fn>` for streams must be return `:eof` at EOF.

Example:

```lisp
> (one:for '(:one :two :tree) < cdr $ print)
:ONE
:TWO
:THREE
```

#### `>`: Gathering previous results

Gathering behavior buffers all results of previous operation call and passes it as a list.

```lisp
(one:for <input> ... > <operation> ...)
```

In this case, `<operation>` translates gathering result, like sorting. Note memory usage because of gathering stores all input.

Examples:

```lisp
> (one:for #P"file.txt" < one:read-line* > identity $ print)
("line2" "line1" "line3")

> (one:for #P"file.txt" < one:read-line* > #/(sort _ #'string<) $ print)
("line1" "line2" "line3")
```

#### `+>`: Folding previous results

Folding behavior is a special case of gathering operation like `reduce`. This use memory lesser than gathering.

```lisp
(one:for <input> ... +> <operation> [<init-value>] ...)
```

`<init-value>` is optional. By default `<init-value>` is nil.

In folding, `<operation>` must take two arguments.

Example:

```lisp
> (one:for '("line2" "line1" "line3") < cdr
    +> (lambda (i v) (format nil "~a ~a" i v)) "" $ print)
" line2 line1 line3"
```

#### `?`: Selection previous results

Selection behavior passes previous operation results through, if the result satisfies `predicate`.

```lisp
(one:for <input> ... ? <predicate> ...)
```

Example:

```lisp
> (one:for '("one" "two" "three" "twenty-one") < cdr ? (search "one" _) $ print)
"one"
"twenty-one"
```
